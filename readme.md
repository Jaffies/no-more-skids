#No more skids tool


What does this tool do:


	Allows to check client's game files


	Allows to check client's lua state (functions, \_G table, hooks, etc)


	Checks if user is in cheater list


This is not an anti-cheat, but you can make modules to detect cheats


Important:

If you want to use Discord webhooks, you should download gmod-chttp from github.
